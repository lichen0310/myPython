How many billable hours would you expect this to take?

Edgardo Gomez 07:09 PM
Hey! Robert Landau

Thank you for reaching out to me.

Robert Landau 07:09 PM
heya

Edgardo Gomez 07:10 PM
I am very interested in your project.

Very exciting

I think I can work on your job

Robert Landau 07:10 PM
Not really that exciting lol, but yes, would like to get it done.

The poll closes in about 20 hours

Edgardo Gomez 07:10 PM
because I have some experience in bot development and VPN.

20hours?

Robert Landau 07:11 PM
Mhmm

Edgardo Gomez 07:11 PM
So you mean this is very urgent task? Should we build it within 20hrs?

Robert Landau 07:11 PM
Correct.

Edgardo Gomez 07:12 PM
Ok. Understand!

No problem

Urbanize Atlanta
Best OTP Downtown 2023, Elite Eight (4) Lawrenceville vs. (5) Woodstock
Who should advance to the Suburban Smackdown Final Four? Cast your vote now!
This is the poll

I need Lawrenceville to win, but not by too much, sorta situation.

How much do you think it will cost?

Edgardo Gomez 07:14 PM
I can finish within 15hrs. - 32 * 15 = 480$ but
I can work in 400.

Is it Okay for you?

Robert Landau 07:14 PM
Ah, that's more than we are willing to throw at this, sorry ðŸ˜ž

Thank you though.

Edgardo Gomez 07:14 PM
Hey

Please stay there

How much do you agree?

Robert Landau 07:15 PM
Honestly, I was really hoping to do it for about $100 or less.

But I don't want you to spend so much time on it for so little money

If you think it's going to take that long it seems not worth it.

Edgardo Gomez 07:16 PM
I can finish it within 8 ~ 9hrs. I have source code already!

9hrs is enough for you?

Robert Landau 07:17 PM
Not at $32/hr, I'm sorry, I really can't afford that. :(. If it was only going to be an hour or two, sure, but I don't have budget for a full blown project, even a small one.

Edgardo Gomez 07:17 PM
Ok

That's fine

Robert Landau 07:17 PM
Sorry

Edgardo Gomez 07:18 PM
I agree with your budget!

No problem

You will have another task after this? Right?

Robert Landau 07:18 PM
Um, honestly, probably not, this was kind of a spur of the moment thing.

Edgardo Gomez 07:18 PM
Even if you don't have any other task, I hope to work in this project.

Because I have source code already, so I wanna help you.
